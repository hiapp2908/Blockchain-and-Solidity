Solidity

First Smart Contract (Simple Storage)


Defining Version 

We have to define version in order to make compiler ready for the type of contract we are writing.
This is an evolving language right now so we have to specify which version we have written our code for.

To specify Single version
pragma  solidity 0.6.0;

To specify a single number of version
pragma solidity ^0.6.0;  //That means from 0.6.0 to 0.6.99

To specify a range of versions
pragma solidity >=0.6.0 <0.9.0; ////That means from 0.6.0 to 0.9.0 (not including 0.9.0).
